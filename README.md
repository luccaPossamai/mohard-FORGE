# What's this mod about?

M.O. Hard, the “MO” standing for “more”, is a title we could not part ways with, even though it only reflects one of the mod’s themes. Heightened difficulty and constant evolution were the main additions we wanted to make to the vanilla experience, but the mod developed to a much greater extent. As you’re playing the mod, you’ll first notice a new kind of item added to every mob’s dropping pool. All creatures in the game can drop a fragment of their soul, an empowering essence that could be equiped in the player's altar.
